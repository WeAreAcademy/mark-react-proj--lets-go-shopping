In this project, we will practice with event handlers and two-way input binding.

## Learning Outcomes

- Set up two-way input binding
- Practice with event listeners

## Exercise 1: Minimum viable product

> ðŸŽ¯ **Success criterion:** A MVP shopping list

Create a shopping list which meets the following requirements:
- Adding items to the list:
  - A text input field where the user can type the name of the item they require
  - An add button, to allow the user to add the specified item to their list.
- Showing the list:
  - A list of the items which the user has already added.

You have free rein for how this can look, but for example without much styling, this could look something like: ![](./example-1.png).

## Exercise 2: Holding more information in state

> ðŸŽ¯ **Success criterion:** Can add quantity to new items

Embellish the section for adding items to the list by adding a quantity field: an input for the quantity which is required. Also show the quantities alongside the name in the list of items.

## Extension: Expanding the functionality

> ðŸŽ¯ **Success criterion:** An enhanced shopping list app

Improve the user experience by adding further capabilities to the app, such as:
- Allowing the user to delete items off of the list e.g. if they have changed their mind.
- Allowing the user to mark items as purchased (user case: make the list whilst at home and then mark items as purchased in the supermarket)
- Add number validation to the quantity field
- Not all items can be counted as individiual items, some quantities may be measured in litres or kilgrams: add a dropdown to choose between units such as number, litres or kilograms
- A count of the numbers left to buy
- A filtered list showing only the items left to buy and a success message when the user has bought all items

Please do experiment and add any other ideas which you may have.
The focus here is on functionality rather than appearance and so css should not be your focus.
